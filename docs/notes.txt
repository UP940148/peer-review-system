Database Design:
  - Need to be able to store
    - User information. Primary key can be their Google unique id
    - Work. Primary key can be serial, foreign key should link to author
    - Reviews. Primary key can be serial, foreign key should link to author and related work PK
    - Categories. They probably only need one field, the name of the category. However I might give them a serial primary key
    - Review groups. Group id would be primary key, group leader and roster would be foreign keys
    - Joining table for review groups and users
  When work is uploaded, it should be able to be posted to either a specific group, or to the public (I'm debating a reddit style system where users can only post to groups)
  Users should be able to search for groups that are open to the public

API:
  - I need to use a naming convention. Last time my API looked atrocious
    - Everything should be lowercase (unless it's a variable)
    - Use hyphens for API paths rather than camelCase

Login/Authorisation:
  - I'll use the google API to handle logins and authorisation through the web app

Storing the shared work:
  - Files could be uploaded using something like Multer. The file would be stored in ./www/saved/documents/ and its name would be converted to a unique id (Research needed into Multer/UUID)
  - If a link is being used rather than a pdf file, it could be stored in the database where the reference to the pdf would be
  - I might attempt to have file conversion in the server. If a user tries to upload a file that's not a .pdf but is another kind of document (.docx, etc) then give them the option to continue upload with conversion
  - Might also look at pdf compression to save server storage space
  - Work would need to be saved with a creation date, a user profile linked to them, and a date when it was last edited. Edited date for a link version might prove challenging though, so would likely just depend on the creator telling us when it's been updated

Adding reviews:
  - People could have the option to leave reviews as either plain text which would be done in a standard text box, or they could leave reviews in html format. The reviews would be saved as files with references in the database
  - Reviews would need to be saved with a creation date, a user profile linked to them, and a date when it was last edited


Features and API calls:
- When creating a profile, need to POST to user table
  - Might need to POST to Multer API for profile pictures, then respond with new filename
- When creating a group, need to POST to groups table and POST to registration table
  - Might need to POST to Multer API for group pictures, then respond with new filename
- When joining group, need to POST to registration table
- When uploading work, need to POST to work table, and POST to share table
  - Will also need to POST to Multer API call and use the response(with new filename) to POST document
- When uploading a reply, need to POST to reply table
  [REDACTED]: - Will also need to POST to Multer API call and use the response(with new filename) to POST reply
- When searching for groups need to GET from groups table (using groupName selector)
- When viewing feed, need to GET from work (using userId, to check registration, and match with share table)
- When viewing group feed, need to GET from work (using groupId and comparing share table to get documents)
- When viewing replies, need to GET from reply table using shareId
- When updating work, need to PATCH document table using documentId
- When updating profile, need to PATCH user table using userId
  - Will also need to POST to Multer API call and use the response(with new filename) to POST document
