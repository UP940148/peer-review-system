# Peer Review System

## Proposed features

- Create your own profile with a display name and profile picture
- Users can create groups with a name, group image, and a member ranking system
- Users can upload work in many different forms (still working on a list of options)
- Users can post their work to different groups that they are members of
- Users should be able to search for existing public groups and join them
- Users should be able to see all work in groups that they are signed up to
- Users should be able to see and reply to comments on posts. This will be the main form of feedback for the users' work
- Users should be able to report a post or comment
- Group admins should be able to de-rank and/or remove users from groups
- Group admins should be able to review user reports and mark them as seen (archive them)
  - Admins would then decide whether any punishment is required such as banning/revoking privileges
