# Peer Review System

## Proposed features

- Create your own profile with a display name and profile picture
- Create groups with a name, group image, and a member ranking system
- Upload work to groups with a title, a description, categories, and a link to a document that's either a .pdf or a URL to a public document
- Search for groups and join them
- Leave groups you have joined
- Browse work that's been shared with you
- Reply to a piece of work. Either as a standard reply to the work, or a reply to another reply
- Report a user's work or a reply they've made
- Group admins should be able to review user reports and mark them as seen (archive them)
- Group admins should be able to de-rank and/or remove users from groups

## Proposed Categories

### Education Levels

The specification is to build a tool that university students can use. But I see no reason I can't try and open it up to students at any level.

- GCSE
- A-Level
- Higher Education

### Subject Areas

- English
- Maths
- Science
- History
- Geography
- Languages
- Design and Technology
- Art and Design
- Music
- Physical Education
- Computing
- Religious Education

I also think I could implement a system where users can tag their work with custom tags for more specific areas of study. I need to look into that a bit more.

## Progress Tracker (WIP)

- [ ] 1) Have a welcome page with Google login button
- [ ] 2) Have an account page that shows you your profile information
- [ ] 3) Have a page where users can view their current groups and search for public groups to join
- [ ] 4) Have a 'News Feed' where users can view work that has been made available to them through their groups
- [ ] 5) Have a page that opens your selected work and shows replies on it
